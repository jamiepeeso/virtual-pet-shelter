Ms. Peeso’s Shelter for Peculiar Pets is a virtual pet shelter that houses homeless pets that tend to be on the exotic side.
 
You are able to feed or hydrate all of our pets in the shelter and play with an individual pet.
You are also able to adopt a peculiar pet and give them a safe and happy home.
If you should find a strange virtual creature on your travels, Ms. Peeso’s Shelter for Peculiar Pets accepts drop offs.
 
*TIP* These virtual pets are happiest when their needs are as close to 0 as possible.
 
Have fun playing with all of our rare animals.
